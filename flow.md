Application state is generated by reducer functions
- That's why our state currently only has books which comes form the books reducer

Books Reducer
- always returns an array of book objects

- Added books reducer to the combineReducers, which adds key of books to global application state and value points to return of BooksReducer


BookList
- Because we wanted BookList to know it's state, we made it container
- To make it a container, we hooked in connect and then did a mapStateToProps


Action Creators return an action object. That action object is sent through all the reducers which decide whether/how to respond based on switch statements


1. app.js imports BookList container and renders it
2. BookList imports selectBook action from index.js
3. BookList imports bindActionCreators from redux


1. User clicks on book
2. User onClick triggers selectBook action creator (which is imported)
3. selectBook returns an action with type of 'BOOK_SELECTED' and payload of that book
